-   `git remote --verbose`
    -   Shows the remotes you have setup. Github should be the origin.
-   `git remote show origin`
    -   Shows what branch the remote branch is tracking.
    -   Shows the local branch configured for `git pull`
    -   Shows the local ref(?) configured for `git push`

# Git Workflow

-   `git branch [BRANCH-NAME like create-function/function_name_version/fix-thing/update-thing]`
    -   Create a branch with a single goal.
    -   Make branch have no spaces, use a hyphen `-` when you would use a space.
    -   ! Make sure that there is no work in progress (WIP) on the current branch!
    -   If there is use GitKraken as it will make a stash of that WIP that you can
        add to the branch you created.
-   `git checkout [BRANCH-NAME]`
    -   Switch to new branch
-   Make changes to scripts and save changes.
-   `git status`
    -   See what has been changed in repo since last commit.
    -   `<option> -s --short`
        -   ?? = Untracked files
        -   A  = Added
        -   D  = Deleted
        -   M  = Modified
        -   R  = Renamed
        -   T  = Type changed
-   `git add path/to/the/changed/file`
    -   Stage small changes towards branch goal
-   `git commit -m "WIP"`
    -   Save changes in a work in progress (WIP) commit. `-m` is the message in
        the commit.
-   `git commit --amend --no-edit`
    -   After staging additional changes, amend additional changes to WIP commit.
    -   `--no-edit` retains the current message of WIP commit.
-   `git commit --amend -m "Implement awesome feature; closes #43"`
    -   When you want the final changes for a commit, amend again but now add in
        the new message.
-   `git commit <options>`
    -   `-a --all`
        -   Automatically stage all files that have been modified or deleted, but
            not new files that have been added(?).
    -   `-m --message`
        -   Commit message. begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character)
            line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description.
        -   Add two `-m` to have the first message act as a headline and the 
            second message act as the description.
-   checkout main branch
-   git pull from github (origin)
-   Integrate any additional changes from origin into current work
-   merge feature branch to main branch
-   Before pushing new shit onto github, do a pull request to make sure code
    passes QA and tests.
-   `git push`
    -   Finally push changes to github
