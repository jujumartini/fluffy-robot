-   `git remote --verbose`
    -   Shows the remotes you have setup. Github should be the origin.
-   `git remote show origin`
    -   Shows what branch the remote branch is tracking.
    -   Shows the local branch configured for `git pull`
    -   Shows the local ref(?) configured for `git push`

# Git Workflow

-   `git add path/to/the/changed/file`
    -   Stage small changes towards branch goal
-   `git commit -m "WIP"`
    -   Save changes in a work in progress (WIP) commit. `-m` is the message in
        the commit.
-   `git commit --amend --no-edit`
    -   After staging additional changes, amend additional changes to WIP commit.
    -   `--no-edit` retains the current message of WIP commit.
-   `git commit --amend -m "Implement awesome feature; closes #43"`
    -   When you want the final changes for a commit, amend again but now add in
        the new message.
-   checkout main branch
-   git pull from github (origin)
-   Integrate any additional changes from origin into current work
-   merge feature branch to main branch
-   Before pushing new shit onto github, do a pull request to make sure code
    passes QA and tests.
-   `git push`
    -   Finally push changes to github
